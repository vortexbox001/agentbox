# Specification Quality Checklist: Runs Overview Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Product vocabulary permitted by the project (Dagster object names, run status tag intents,
  shared macros, harness terms) is used deliberately and is not treated as an implementation
  leak, per the repository's spec-driven-development guidance.
- The three "decisions to confirm" from the brief (Status/Checks inclusion and column
  position, the tab set, and the home-page destination) are resolved as documented Assumptions
  with informed defaults rather than [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers; each remains open to
  adjustment during `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
